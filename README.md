# Motivational Message Generator

Welcome to the **Motivational Message Generator**! ðŸŽ‰ This project generates inspiring and motivational messages every time you run the program. Whether you're looking for a bit of encouragement to start your day, or some positive words to help you keep going, this tool will provide you with a fresh and unique motivational message each time.

## Features

- **Random Message Generation**: Each message is randomly generated by combining different phrases, ensuring no two messages are the same.
- **Three Customizable Categories**: Messages are composed from three distinct categoriesâ€”`Subjects`, `Actions`, and `Results`â€”providing endless combinations.
- **Instant Motivation**: Run the program anytime you need a quick motivational boost!

### Example Output

Here are a few examples of what you might see when running the generator:

- "The great minds create opportunities from nothing and achieve the success they deserve."
- "Your potential sees endless possibilities and inspires others."
- "Those who never give up overcome every obstacle and live a life full of satisfaction."

## How It Works

The generator creates a message by randomly selecting an element from each of the following categories:
1. **Subjects** â€“ Who is the message addressing? (e.g., "You", "Your team", "Those who dream big")
2. **Actions** â€“ What is happening or what challenge is being tackled? (e.g., "create opportunities from nothing", "overcome every obstacle")
3. **Results** â€“ What is the outcome? (e.g., "and achieve success", "and inspire others")

Each time the program runs, a new, unique motivational message is generated using these elements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

You can check if Node.js is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
node --version
```
If Node.js isn't installed, you can download it from here.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/bort-andrea/Random-Motivational-Message-Menerator.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd motivational-message-generator
```
Install the necessary dependencies (if any). For this basic project, no additional libraries are required:
```
npm install
```
Run the JavaScript file to generate a new motivational message:
```
node generator.js
```
That's it! You'll see a fresh motivational message printed in your terminal every time you run the script.

### Customization
Feel free to customize the lists of subjects, actions, and results in generator.js to better suit your style of motivation or to create personalized messages.

Example Customization
In generator.js, you'll find lists like these:

```
const subjects = ["You", "Your team", "Every challenge you face"];
const actions = ["can conquer any obstacle", "creates new opportunities"];
const results = ["and achieve greatness.", "and inspire the world around you."];
```
You can add your own phrases to these lists or even create entirely new categories to further diversify the motivational messages!

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new features, improvements, or additional categories for messages, feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue on GitHub.
